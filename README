This is a quick test of a WebSocket connection. The server will send the current UTC timestamp every hundredth of a second, and the webpage will read it and prepend it onto the webpage.

Use the version in 2.7 for Python 2.7, and the version in 3.5 for Python 3.5.

Honestly, it's pretty basic. All it does is send a preset message from the server to the webpage. But it gets the job done, and I could put in any message I want, at any time I want.

See comments in the code for details on how it works.


INSTRUCTIONS
1) Download using git clone or as a zip file.
2) Make sure you have the necessary code and packages installed. For python 3.5, this requires the asyncio, websockets, and datetime packages. For python 2.7, this requires the websocket package.
3) Open terminal, and navigate to the WebSocket-Test folder.
4) Navigate to your chosen python version's subfolder.
5) Run server.sh with the following command: bash server.sh
6) Copy and paste the URL from the command into a web browser window, and load the page. The program is known to work in the most recent versions of Google Chrome and Firefox.
