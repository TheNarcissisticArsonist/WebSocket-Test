This is a quick test of a WebSocket connection. The server will send the current UTC timestamp every hundredth of a second, and the webpage will read it and prepend it onto the webpage.
Honestly, it's pretty basic. All it does is send a preset message from the server to the webpage. But it gets the job done, and I could put in any message I want, at any time I want.
See comments in the code for details on how it works.


INSTRUCTIONS *These assume you have everything in one folder"
1) Make sure you have the necessary code and packages installed. This program requires python 3.5 and the asyncio, websockets, and datetime packages.
2) Open terminal, and navigate to the WebSocket-Test folder.
3) Enter the following command: cd ./Webpage; printf "\n\nGo to the following link:\nfile://"; link=`pwd`; printf "$link"; printf "/index.html\n\n\nStarting websocket server.\nPress control+c to exit. Do not use control+c to copy!"; cd ../Server; python3 server.py;
4) Copy and paste the URL from the command into a web browser window, and load the page. The program is known to work in the most recent versions of Google Chrome and Firefox.
